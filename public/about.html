<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am Reza Shah Akhtar, and during my high school years, I believed I was
  exceptionally intelligent. This confidence led me to become very lazy, as I
  assumed I could grasp everything I studied effortlessly. However, once I
  entered university, the situation took a drastic turn. My laziness pulled me
  into a deep sense of ignorance—something I utterly despised, especially in the
  face of so many brilliant peers. Their intelligence only magnified my own
  feelings of inadequacy. I desperately wanted to change and learn new things,
  but my efforts were constantly thwarted by my overwhelming laziness.
</p>
<p>
  Laziness became like a vice—once you fall into its trap, you find yourself
  stuck in a slippery glass that’s nearly impossible to escape. I became
  undisciplined, inconsistent, and prone to mood swings. At that point, I felt
  like the most foolish person in the world, lacking any meaningful skills, all
  because I had succumbed to laziness. I fell far behind my peers.

<p>
  One day, my parents called to discuss the financial aspects of paying for my
  education. That conversation hit me hard—I thought, "I'm being paid a
  significant amount to attend university, yet here I am, wasting it by being
  lazy. What kind of person am I?" It was then that I realized I had to break
  free from that slippery glass. I began to build habits that would help me
  develop new skills. Now, I am fully committed to becoming an expert in machine
  learning, web development, and electrical circuit design. These fields are not
  just important—they are the foundation of my future success.

<p>
  Laziness is indeed terrifying.
